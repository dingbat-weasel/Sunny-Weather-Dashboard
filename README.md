# Sunny Weather Dashboard

## Description

An easy to use weather forecast dashboard. Enter a city and receive a current and a 5-day forecast. Recent searches are saved and your most recent search will be saved beyond leaving and returning to the site. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS. It requests data from the openweather API.
This project helped me learn a lot about fetching information from API's and really helped me up my JS game. Thanks for checking it out!
